# PCMs_SICP.jl
This is my personal reconstruction of SICP in Pluto/Julia. It is published here in the expectation that the Pluto/Julia community is willing to provide bug reports and code improvements because you never can be certain that you found the most efficient and elegant solution. 
The seminal book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)" was the introductory CS course at the MIT for years (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). The book presented in both editions algorithms in the Scheme dialect MIT-Scheme. Later on the book's content was published as html-files in the public domain (https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html). 
Though the MIT-CS course switched over to Python when new lecturers took over the responsibility, the website remained the same in content and url-location.
This year (2022) MIT Press did not provide a follow-up edition "SICP in Python" but an edition in Javascript (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs,_JavaScript_Edition). This is a bit astonishing because the target audience of SICP-Scheme editions were CS and electrical engineers. These students don't use JS for their work.
In the last two years I became more acquainted with Julia partly because of David Barber's (http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage) recommendation and party because some time later I came across the elegant probabilistic programming language TURING (https://github.com/TuringLang). I realized that Julia is a more natural and more efficient successor of Scheme than JS. 
Now, I learn't some more Julia so that I try to transpile the original MIT-Scheme code in Pluto/Julia. Here's the result of my enterprise.
