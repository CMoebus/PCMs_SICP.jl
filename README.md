# PCMs_SICP.jl
### Learning Julia/Pluto.jl by Self-exploring SICP
Here we present transpilations of SICP-Scheme-scripts into Julia as well as alternatives exploiting idiographic JULIA constructs within a Pluto.jl-embedding. Pluto.jl offers reactive notebooks very suitable for educational purposes. We use Pluto.jl as a learning environment for self-guided learning Julia. SICP is expected to be the accompanying study-guide. All SICP-Scheme-scripts are reconstructed in Julia in a stepwise manner. In the end it is guaranteed that the learner has acquired several competencies. S|he is competent in understanding CS-concepts, reading Scheme-scripts, and developing new scripts in Julia/Pluto.jl. Learners expecting a gamified learning environment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification_of_learning) will be disappointed. This is a rather academic learning experience. The time needed is not trivial. We estimate that a newbee to programming needs 12 months (2 semesters) of self-studying chapter 1-2 and further 12 months (2 semesters) for chapter 3-4.
