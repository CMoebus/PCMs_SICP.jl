# PCMs_SICP.jl
This is my personal reconstruction of SICP in Pluto/Julia. It is published here in the expectation that the Pluto/Julia community is willing to provide bug reports and code improvements. The seminal book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)" was the introductory CS course at the MIT for years (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs). The book presented in both editions algorithms in the Scheme dialect MIT-Scheme. Later on the book's content was published as html-files in the public domain (https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html). 
Though the MIT-CS course switched over to Python when new lecturers took over the responsibility, the website remained the same in Scheme-code and url-location.
MIT Press did not provide a follow-up edition "SICP in Python" but an edition in Javascript (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs,_JavaScript_Edition). This is a bit astonishing because JS is not a language aimed at CS students or engineers (this was the original target audience).
In the last two years I became more acquainted with Julia party because David Barber (http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage) recommended that language to me and some time later I stumbled over the elegant probabilistic programming language TURING (https://github.com/TuringLang).
