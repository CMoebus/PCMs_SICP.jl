## Learning Julia/Pluto.jl by Self-exploring SICP
Here we present transpilations of SICP-Scheme-scripts into Julia as well as alternatives exploiting idiomatic JULIA constructs within a Pluto.jl-embedding. Pluto.jl offers reactive notebooks very suitable for educational purposes. 

We use Pluto.jl as a learning environment for self-guided learning Julia. SICP is expected to be the accompanying study-guide. All SICP-Scheme-scripts are reconstructed in Julia in a stepwise manner. Furthermore idiomatic Julia scripts are added to demonstrate solutions made possible by advanced Julia features.

In the end it is guaranteed that the learner has acquired several competencies. S|he is competent in understanding CS-concepts, reading Scheme-scripts, and developing new scripts in Julia/Pluto.jl. 

Learners expecting a gamified learning environment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification_of_learning) will be disappointed. This is a rather academic (dry ;) ) learning experience. So your intrinsic motivation in studying Julia should be rather high.

The time needed is not trivial. We estimate that a newbee to programming needs 12 months (2 semesters) of self-studying SICP and SICP.jl (the original SICP-book and our Julia-scripts). The time investment should be 1-2 hours per day. It is expected that some of the SICP-exercises should be solved..

Ok, let's go !
